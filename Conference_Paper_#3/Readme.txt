This code is for data processing part in my paper "Accurate Food Quality Estimation Using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks and RF Energy Harvesting"

+ Description:
   In this project, I developed some ML models to classify food quality based on the environment data (Temperature, air pressure) inside the food package during preservation. Four ML models were implemented: 1D-CNN, MLP, LSTM, and SVM. The results showed that the proposed LSTM classifier achieves the best accuracy on all three food datasets ( Pork, Fish, and Chicken). The food classification performance is investigated based on training accuracy and confusion matrix.

+ Tools:
 - Python
 - jupyter notebook
 - google colab
 - keras, pandas, matplotlib,etc.
 
+ Resutls:
Check the attached paper and the notebook for details.
